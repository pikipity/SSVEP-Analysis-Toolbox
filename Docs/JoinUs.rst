    #. Fork this `this repository <https://github.com/pikipity/SSVEP-Analysis-Toolbox.git>`_ from the Github. You may read `"Forking a repository" <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository>`_ to learn how to do it. Simply speaking, you just need to click the "Fork" button in the repository page.
    #. After you fork this repository, you can edit it. You may face the following problems:

            3.  Install the required packages. Go to the repository dictionary. In your terminal, use ``conda env create -f environment.yml`` to create a new virtual enviroment called ``ssvep_analysis_toolbox``. All packages will be automatically installed.
            4.  In your terminal, you can use ``conda activate ssvep_analysis_toolbox`` to enable this virtual enviroment.

       + How to implement a dataset? Please follow :ref:`define-own-dataset` and ref the existing codes to implement your dataset.
       + How to implement a method? Please follow :ref:`common-functions-in-methods` and ref the existing codes to implement the required functions.

    #. After you finish your work. You can create a pull request to our ``dev`` branch (you may read `"Create a pull request" <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_ to learn how to create a pull request).
