If you find bugs, you can report your issues in `"Issues" <https://github.com/pikipity/SSVEP-Analysis-Toolbox/issues>`_.
+ Contribute to this toolbox. You can help us implement existing datasets or existing algorithms. You also can provide your own datasets or proposed algorithms to this toolbox. All your contributions will be displayed in :ref:`contributors-page`. You can follow the below steps to contribute to this toolbox.

    .. note::

        Because we are also working on this toolbox, what you want to implement may be already finished but has not been published. To avoid the duplicate work, you may check the following work plan and contact us by Email (pikiptyw@gmail.com) before you want to add existing datasets or existing algorithms.

    #. Fork this `this repository <https://github.com/pikipity/SSVEP-Analysis-Toolbox.git>`_ from the Github. You may read `"Forking a repository" <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository>`_ to learn how to do it. Simply speaking, you just need to click the "Fork" button in the repository page.
    #. After you fork this repository, you can edit it. You may face the following problems:
       
       + How to set up the python development enviroment? You may follow the below procedures:
         
            1.  Install the `vscode <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_. In vscode, you may want to install the useful extension ``Python``.
            2.  Install the `Anaconde <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_. You can go to the `Conda User Guide <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html>`_ to learn how to use the conda.
            3.  Install the required packages. Go to the repository dictionary. In your terminal, use ``conda env create -f environment.yml`` to create a new virtual enviroment called ``ssvep_analysis_toolbox``. All packages will be automatically installed.
            4.  In your terminal, you can use ``conda activate ssvep_analysis_toolbox`` to enable this virtual enviroment.

       + How to implement a dataset? Please follow :ref:`define-own-dataset` and ref the existing codes to implement your dataset.
       + How to implement a method? Please follow :ref:`common-functions-in-methods` and ref the existing codes to implement the required functions.

    #. After you finish your work. You can create a pull request to our ``dev`` branch (you may read `"Create a pull request" <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_ to learn how to create a pull request). If we think your codes are satisfied, we will merge your codes to the ``main`` branch.
