In this toolbox, the standard CCA (sCCA) are regarded as a special case of the filterbank CCA (FBCCA) that only have one filterbank. Spatial filters are found to maximize the similarity between the EEG signals and the sine-cosine-based reference signals, which can be presented as

.. math::

    \mathbf{U}_i, \mathbf{V}_i = \arg\max_{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{Y}_i\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{v}}}

where :math:`\mathbf{X}` denotes the testing multi-channel EEG signal, :math:`\mathbf{Y}_i` denotes the sine-cosine-based reference signal of the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus, :math:`\mathbf{U}_i` is the spatial filter of the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus, and :math:`\mathbf{V}_i` is the harmonic weights of the reference signal for the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus.

The stimulus with the highest similarity is regarded as the target:

.. math::

    \arg\max_{i\in\left\{1,2,\cdots,I\right\}}\left\{ \frac{\mathbf{U}_i^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{V}_i}{\sqrt{\mathbf{U}_i^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{U}_i\mathbf{V}_i^T\mathbf{Y}_i\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{V}_i}} \right\}

where :math:`I` denotes the total number of stimuli.

    FBCCA implemented directly following above equations.

    :param n_component: Number of components of eigen vectors that will be applied as the spatial filters. The default number is ``1``, which means the eigen vector with the highest eigen value is regarded as the spatial filter.

The itCCA is similar as the sCCA, but it uses the averaged template signals to compute the spatial filters. The corresponding correlation coefficient is 

.. math::

    r = \max_{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{X}\overline{\mathbf{X}}_i^T\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{X}\overline{\mathbf{X}}_i^T\mathbf{v}}}

where :math:`\overline{\mathbf{X}}_i` denotes the averaged template signal of the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus. 

The eCCA not only applies the sine-cosine-based reference signals but also uses the averaged template signals. Three types of spatial filters are computed:

.. math::

    \mathbf{U}_{1,i}, \mathbf{V}_{1,i} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{Y}_i\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{v}}}

Four types of corresponding correlation coefficients can be computed:

.. math::

    r_{1,i} = \frac{\mathbf{U}_{1,i}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{V}_{1,i}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{U}_{1,i}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{U}_{1,i}\mathbf{V}_{1,i}^T\mathbf{Y}_i\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{V}_{1,i}}}

The target stimulus is predicted by combining four correlation coefficients together:

.. math::

    \arg\max_{i\in\left\{1,2,\cdots,I\right\}}\left\{ \sum_{k=1}^4 \text{sign}\left\{r_{k,i}\right\}\cdot r_{k,i}^2 \right\}

The multi-stimulus CCA (ms-CCA) considers reference signals and template signals of target stimulus and stimuli with stimulus frequencies are close to that of target stimulus, which includes the phase information and thus improve the recognition accuracy. The spatial filters are computed by

.. math::

    \mathbf{U}_i, \mathbf{V}_i = \arg\max_{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{A}_i\mathbf{B}_i^T\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{A}_i\mathbf{A}_i^T\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{B}_i\mathbf{B}_i^T\mathbf{v}}}

where :math:`\mathbf{A}_i` is the concatenated template signal defined as :math:`\mathbf{A}_i = \left[\overline{\mathbf{X}}_{i-m},\cdots,\overline{\mathbf{X}}_{i},\cdots,\overline{\mathbf{X}}_{i+n}\right]`, and :math:`\mathbf{B}_i` is the concatenated reference signal defined as :math:`\mathbf{A}_i = \left[\mathbf{Y}_{i-m},\cdots,\mathbf{Y}_{i},\cdots,\mathbf{Y}_{i+n}\right]`.

Two types of correlation coefficients are computed:

.. math::

    r_{1,i} = \frac{\mathbf{U}_{i}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{V}_{i}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{U}_{i}^T\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{U}_{i}\mathbf{V}_{i}^T\mathbf{Y}_i\mathbf{Y}_i^T\mathbf{V}_{i}}}

    :param n_jobs: Number of threadings. If the given value is larger than 1, the parallel computation will be applied to improve the computational speed. Default is ``None``, which means the parallel computation will not be applied.

For each stimulus, the MsetCCA maximize the inter-trial covariance to compute the spatial filters. The spatial filters of different trials are different.

where :math:`\widetilde{\mathbf{w}}_{i,n}` denotes the spatial filter of the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus and the :math:`n\text{-th}` training trial, :math:`N_t` denotes the number of training trials, and :math:`\cal{X}_{i,n}` denotes the calibration data of the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus and the :math:`n\text{-th}` training trial.

The key idea of the SSCOR is similar as the TRCA. The SSCOR also finds the common spatial filter across trials, but it assumes the spatial filters of differet trials are different. The SSCOR computes the common spatial filter :math:`\mathbf{U}_i` and the spatial filter :math:`\mathbf{U}_i^{(j)}` of the :math:`j\text{-th}` trial for the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus by solving

.. math:: 

    \max_{\mathbf{U}_i\text{ and }\mathbf{U}_i^{(j)}}\sum_{j=1}^{N_t}\left( \mathbf{U}_i^T\overline{\mathbf{X}}_i\left(\mathbf{X}_i^{(j)}\right)^T\mathbf{U}_i^{(j)} \right)^2

Based on the `Cholesky decomposition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition>`_, we have

Let's define :math:`\mathbf{U}_i = \left(\mathbf{K}_i^{\overline{\mathbf{X}}}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{V}_i`, :math:`\mathbf{U}_i^{(j)} = \left( \mathbf{K}_{i,j}^{\mathbf{X}} \right)^{-1}\mathbf{V}_i^{(j)}`, :math:`\mathbf{G}_i^{(j)}=\left(\mathbf{K}_i^{\overline{\mathbf{X}}}\right)^{-T}\mathbf{C}_{i,j}^{\overline{\mathbf{X}}}\left(\mathbf{K}_{i,j}^{\mathbf{X}}\right)^{-1}`, and :math:`\mathbf{C}_{i,j}^{\overline{\mathbf{X}}} = \overline{\mathbf{X}}_i\left( \mathbf{X}_i^{(j)} \right)^T`, we get

Task-discriminant component analysis
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Eng.*, vol. 29, pp. 1998-2007, 2021. DOI: `10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3114340 <https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3114340>`_.

Compared with other methods, the task-discriminant component analysis (TDCA) have following three key differences:

1. The dimensionality of EEG signals is elevated. For one trial EEG signal :math:`\mathbf{X}`, the augmented EEG trial :math:`\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}` is

   .. math::
      
      \widetilde{\mathbf{X}} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
                                        \mathbf{X}, & \mathbf{O}_0\\
                                        \mathbf{X}_1, & \mathbf{O}_1\\
                                        \vdots & \\
                                        \mathbf{X}_L, & \mathbf{O}_L
                                      \end{array} \right]
   
   where :math:`\mathbf{X}_l` denotes the EEG trial delayed by :math:`l` points, :math:`\mathbf{O}_l\in\mathbb{R}^{N_\text{ch}\times l}` denotes the zero matrix, and :math:`L` is the total number of delays. 

2. After elevating the dimension, EEG trials are then further extended for each stimulus as

   .. math::

      \mathbf{X}_a = \left[ \widetilde{\mathbf{X}},\;\; \widetilde{\mathbf{X}}\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{Q}_i^T \right]

   where :math:`\mathbf{Q}_i` is the orthogonal factor of the reference signal of the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus and can be obtained by the QR decomposition :math:`\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{Y}_i^T`.

3. The two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis is applied to compute spatial filters by solving

   .. math::

      \mathbf{S}_b\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{S}_w\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Lambda}

   The :math:`\mathbf{S}_b` is the covariance of between-class differences:

   .. math::

      \mathbf{S}_b = \frac{1}{I} \sum_{i=1}^I \left( \overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)} - \frac{1}{I}\sum_{i=1}^I\overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)} \right)\left( \overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)} - \frac{1}{I}\sum_{i=1}^I\overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)} \right)^T

   where :math:`\overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)}` is the averaged :math:`\mathbf{X}_a` over all trials of the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus, and :math:`I` is the total number of stimuli.

   The :math:`\mathbf{S}_w` is the covariance of within-class differences:

   .. math::

      \mathbf{S}_w = \frac{1}{N_t} \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^{N_t} \left( \mathbf{X}_a^{(i,j)} - \overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)} \right) \left( \mathbf{X}_a^{(i,j)} - \overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)} \right)^T

   where :math:`N_t` denotes the total number of trials, and :math:`\mathbf{X}_a^{(i,j)}` denotes :math:`\mathbf{X}_a` of the :math:`j\text{-th}` trial for the :math:`i\text{-th}` stimulus.

Finally, the target stimulus can be predicted by 

.. math::

    \arg\max_{i\in\left\{1,2,\cdots,I\right\}}\left\{ \frac{\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{X}_a\left(\overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)}\right)^T\mathbf{U}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{X}_a\mathbf{X}_a^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}_i^T\left(\overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)}\right)\left(\overline{\mathbf{X}}_a^{(i)}\right)^T\mathbf{U}_i}} \right\}

    :param n_component: Number of components of eigen vectors that will be applied as the spatial filters. The default number is ``1``, which means the eigen vector with the highest eigen value is regarded as the spatial filter.

    :param weights_filterbank: Weights of filterbanks. It is a list of float numbers. Default is ``None``, which means all weights of filterbanks are 1.

    :param n_delay: Total number of delays. Default is ``0``, which means no delay.

Compared to sCCA, the spatial filters are fine-turned online. Therefore, as more trials are processed, the performance will be improved until achieving the upper bound. 

The OACCA ensembles three parts:

1. Spatial filters based on the sCCA. These spatial filters can be considered as the baseline reference of the recognition result.

2. Prototype spatial filters. These spatial filters are fine-turned online. They are calculated by

   .. math::

      \mathbf{u}_0^{[t+1]}=\arg\max_{\mathbf{u}}\frac{\mathbf{u}^T\left[ \sum_{m=1}^t\widetilde{\mathbf{u}}^{[m]}\left(\widetilde{\mathbf{u}}^{[m]}\right)^T \right]\mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{u}}

   where :math:`\widetilde{\mathbf{u}}^{[t]} = \frac{\mathbf{u}^{[t]}}{\left\|\mathbf{u}^{[t]}\right\|}` and :math:`\mathbf{u}^{[t]}` is the spatial filtered obtained from the sCCA at the :math:`t\text{-th}` trial.

3. Spatial filters based on the online ms-CCA. These spatial filters are also fine-turned online. They are calculated by 

   .. math::

      \mathbf{u}^{[t+1]},\;\mathbf{v}^{[t+1]}=\max_{\mathbf{u},\;\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{C}_{XY}^{[t]}\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{C}_{XY}^{[t]}\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}^T\mathbf{v}}}

   where :math:`\mathbf{C}_{XY}^{[t]}=\sum_{m=1}^t\left(\mathbf{X}^{[t]}\right)^T\mathbf{Y}`.
